# Personal Budget Manager

## Description

This project aims to help users manage their finances more effectively and prevent overspending, using envelope budgeting method.

It divides income into different spending categories and limits spending to the allocated amount for each category. The budget and category amount is deducted with each transaction. This system helps users manage their finances, prevents overspending, and promotes healthier spending habits. Itâ€™s a modern tool for personal finance management, suitable for anyone looking to gain better control over their finances.
